          Kyrin Grey creates contemporary dance theatre shaped by story, structure, and sound. A former professional dancer who transitioned to a career in data science before returning to the stage, Grey's work reflects a mind equally attuned to musical architecture and emotional narrative. He draws from an eclectic musical palette that spans genres and eras and loves to use live music in his performances. He continues to perform in his own productions and in collaboration with local artists and arts organizations.

            <p class="work-meta">15 minutes | 3 dancers | premiered in 2023 at Yaw Theater</p>
            <p>A Story of Love OR Death is a classic love triangle. Inga loves Olga. Helga loves Olga. Olga loves... Olga? Created for the Wielding Forms Dance Festival, co-produced by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coriolisdance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coriolis Dance</a> and <a href="https://www.yawtheater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yaw Theater</a>. The festival explored the element of chance in live performance. Embracing this challenge, everything from the music and dancer footwear to the ending of the story were all decided by a coin flip, a dice roll, a card draw, and a game of rock, paper, scissors.</p>
