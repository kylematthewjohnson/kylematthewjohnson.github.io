DESCRIPTION:
A Story of Love OR Death is a classic love triangle. Inga loves Olga. Helga loves Olga. Olga loves... Olga? Created for the Wielding Forms Dance Festival, co-produced by Coriolis Dance and Yaw Theater. The festival explored the element of chance in live performance. Embracing this challenge, everything from the music and dancer footwear to the ending of the story were all decided by a coin flip, a dice roll, a card draw, and a game of rock, paper, scissors.
