			<section class="step">
				First let's take a moment to look back at the past few presidential election cycles.<br><br>
				<div class="title">2000</div>
				<b>Bush vs. Gore</b><br><br>2000 saw the eldest son of former President George H.W. Bush take on Vice President Al Gore. After 8 years under the leadership of Bill Clinton, and after Clinton's impeachment in his second term as president, the nation was ready for a change. A total of 11 states flipped from democrat to republican in 2000, and although Gore won the popular vote, Bush won the most electoral votes, becoming the 43rd President of the United States in one of the closest elections in US history.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				<div class="title">2004</div>
				<b>Bush vs. Kerry</b><br>9 months into George W. Bush's tenure the 9/11 attacks rattled the nation, and less than a month later the US invaded Afghanistan, beginning the longest war in US history. While the country remained at War, as change in leadership was not favorable, and while New Hamsphire flipped democrat in 2004, Iowa and New Mexico flipped republican, solidifying Bush's lead over US Senator John Kerry.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				<div class="title">2008</div>
				<b>Obama vs. McCain</b><br>While the war in Afghanistan may have brought about some national unity in 2004, by 2008 with little progress to show the nation was hungry for change. The up and coming junior US Senator Barack Obama took on senior US senator John McCain and took the nation by storm. 9 states flipped democrat in 2008, and Barack Obama became the first African American president in US history.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				<div class="title">2012</div>
				<b>Obama vs. Romney</b><br>The stock market crash of 2008-2009 had a devastating effect on the US economy, and although its roots preceded Obama's presidency, it did manage to temper some of the excitement that permeated the 2008 election. Obama secured a 2nd term, but by a smaller margin, with Indiana and North Carolina flipping republican in favor of former Governer of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				<div class="title">2016</div>
				<b>Trump vs. Clinton</b><br>2016 brought us the race of former first lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, and first female presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and US businessman Donald J. Trump. The race was full of controversies, around Trumps past behavior and antics, the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee servers. Amidst the chaos a total of 6 states flipped republican, and while Clinton won the popular vote by an even greater margin than Gore in 2000, the electoral votes were in Trump's favor and Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States.

				With this information in mind, let's make some predictions...
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				Following Bill Clinton's impeachment in his second turn, there was a shift in the 2000 election and more than 11 states flipped republican in that election cycle. <br><br>Trump was impeached in his first term and if reelected in 2020 would be the first president to be reelected to office following impeachment.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				The stock market crash of 2008-2009 soured national favorability of Barack Obama despite its roots preceding his presidency. <br><br>The recent stock market crash due to the Corona Virus, as well as the president's response to the Corona Virus itself, may sour his national favorability leading up to the 2020 election.
			</section>
			<section class="step">
				With these factors and the current polling numbers in mind, let's do some math.<br><br>If all other states stay the same and Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all flip democrat this cycle as the current polling numbers indicate they could, the democratic candidate would win 275 electoral votes, putting them above the threshold of 270 needed to win the election...

				While polling numbers have proved unreliable many times in the past, we're gonna go out on a limb as make a prediction.
